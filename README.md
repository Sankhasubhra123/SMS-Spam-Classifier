# 📧 SMS & Email Spam Classifier

This repository showcases a fully developed machine learning project focused on detecting spam messages in both SMS and email formats. Built in *PyCharm* using the *UCI SMS Spam Collection dataset*, the project guides users through the complete ML pipeline — from raw text to real-time classification.

## ⚙ Project Highlights

- 🔍 *Data Exploration*: Conducted in Jupyter Notebook for initial insights
- 🧼 *Data Cleaning*: Removal of noise, duplicates, and irrelevant entries
- 📊 *EDA*: Visualization and statistical analysis of spam vs ham patterns
- 🧠 *Text Preprocessing*: Includes tokenization, stemming, stopwords removal
- 🔤 *TF-IDF Vectorization*: For converting text into model-ready features
- 🤖 *Model Building*: Implemented Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression & others
- 📈 *Performance Optimization*: Hyperparameter tuning & metric evaluation
- 💻 *PyCharm Workflow*: Local development and testing environment
- 🌐 *Heroku Deployment*: Cloud-based real-time spam detection 


## 🧠 Technologies Used

- Python  
- Scikit-learn  
- Pandas & NumPy  
- Matplotlib & Seaborn  
- NLTK  
- Heroku (for deployment)
