# SMS-Spam-Classifier
SMS &amp; Email Spam Classifier is a full ML project built in PyCharm using the UCI dataset. It features EDA, text preprocessing (tokenization, stemming, TF-IDF), model training, and performance optimization. The final model is deployed on Heroku, enabling real-time spam detection via a responsive web interface.

# 📧 SMS & Email Spam Classifier

This repository showcases a fully developed machine learning project focused on detecting spam messages in both SMS and email formats. Built in *PyCharm* using the *UCI SMS Spam Collection dataset*, the project guides users through the complete ML pipeline — from raw text to real-time classification.
